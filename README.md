Instructions:

1) Extract the AlexNet source file in the source-graphs folder before using it. 

2) Execute the command "make clean; make" in the to clean and compile each partitioning algorithm (in each commit). 

3) The "execute.sh" script contains an execution example. Edit this file to contain the desired parameters and algorithm.

4) Execute "execute.sh" using "bash execute.sh"
